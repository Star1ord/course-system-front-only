# Course System - Client Only Version

This is a client-only version of the Course System that works without a backend. It uses mock data to simulate the backend functionality.

## Features

- Course listing page
- Login page (simulated)
- Responsive design
- Modern UI with Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start the development server
- `npm run build` - Build the project for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview the production build locally

## Mock Data

The application uses mock data to simulate backend responses. You can find the mock data in `src/services/mockApi.js`. Feel free to modify this file to showcase different scenarios.

## Note

This is a simplified version of the Course System that focuses on the frontend design and user interface. It does not include actual backend functionality, but rather simulates it using mock data.
